◆ **Pre-Requirements**
Before deploying the contract, install the necessary tools:

➤ **1. Install Rust**

```sh
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
- After installation, apply the changes:
```sh
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```
- Verify if Rust is installed correctly:
```sh
rustc --version
```
  ✔ If a version number appears, Rust is installed successfully.

➤ **2. Install jq**
- For WSL/Ubuntu, run:
```sh
sudo apt install jq
```
- For Mac, run:
```sh
brew install jq
```
  ✔ After installation, `jq` will be available for processing JSON data.

➤ **3. Install sfoundryup**
- Run the following command to install `sfoundryup`:
```sh
curl -L \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw" \
     "https://api.github.com/repos/SeismicSystems/seismic-foundry/contents/sfoundryup/install?ref=seismic" | bash
```
- Apply the changes to your terminal:
```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```
  ✔ Now, `sfoundryup` is installed and ready to use.

➤ **4. Run sfoundryup**

```
  ✔ You are now in the correct directory to deploy the contract.

➤ **2. Deploy the Contract**

  • Display the wallet address

- **Next Steps:**
  1. Copy the Faucet URL and open it in your browser.
  2. Fund your newly generated wallet using the Faucet.
  3. Once the transaction is complete, your contract deployment is successful.
